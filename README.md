# Snitch #

Network monitor for ClassicPress. Connection overview for monitoring and controlling outgoing data traffic.

## Description ##
Network monitor for ClassicPress with connection overview for controlling and regulating data traffic from your site.

### Trust, But Verify ###
*Snitch* monitors and logs the outgoing data stream of your ClassicPress site. It records every outbound connection from ClassicPress and provides a log table for administrators.

*Snitch* does not only log connection requests, but enables you to block future requests either by target URL (internet address being called in the background), or by script (file being executed to open up a connection). Once blocked, a  connection will be visually highlighted. Blocked entries can be unblocked with a simple click.

*Snitch* is a perfect tool to “listen in” on outbound communication. It is also suitable to early recognize any malware and tracking software installed.

### Summary ###
*Snitch* writes a log of both authorized and blocked attempts of connectivity. An overall view provides transparency and lets you control outgoing connections initialized by plugins, themes, or ClassicPress.
